# PVL - Propeller Vortex Lattice

This repository provides an example implementation of the Vortex Lattice
Method (VLM) for marine propeller design. The algorithms are public domain.

The Fortran source is based on J. E. Kerwin's PVL implementation in the
lecture notes for the MIT course 13.04/2.23 Hydrofoils and Propellers.
[MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW)][ocw] hosts subject material for the course as
taught [Fall 2003][dspace-13.04-2003] and [Spring 2007][ocw-2.23-2007].

Example implementations in more languages are in the works.

This repository is intended as an educational resource.
